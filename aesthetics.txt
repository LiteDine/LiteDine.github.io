Top bar colour: 

	dark red, sets tone well. contrasts with other colours. - #800509

Fonts:

	Cream Peach - for headers and such on the website. Looks aesthetically pleasing
			and calls attention to itself compared to other fonts.

	Typo Grotesk - for body, thinner than cream peach so it will not take attention
			away from it, long letters means the reader feels like they're
			reading more than they are which gives it a satisfying idea.
